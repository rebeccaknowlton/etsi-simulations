This repository contains code to fully reproduce the simulation results and application illustration in Knowlton, R., Parast, L. (2024) ``Efficient Testing Using Surrogate Information," which is under review. Specifically, to reproduce Table 1 in the paper, run the code in the file etsi_sims_110424.R with the setting set to your desired setting; then use the code in etsi_sims_readin.R to read in the results and create the table. To reproduce Table 2, use the code in etsi_design_sims_110424.R with the desired setting set. The file etsi_sims_truth_and_assumptions.R calculates the truth and checks necessary assumptions for the simulation settings. The file aids_example.R includes code to reproduce the AIDS illustration.
