This repository contains code to fully reproduce the simulation results and application illustration in Knowlton, R., Parast, L. (2024) ``Efficient Testing Using Surrogate Information," which is under review. To run the code, you will need to download the R package ``etsi'', which is available at https://github.com/rebeccaknowlton/etsi. Additionally, to reproduce the AIDS examples, you will need to request the data directly from the AIDS Clinical Trial Group. Specifically, you may request the ACTG 320 study and the ACTG 193A study at https://actgnetwork.org/submit-a-proposal.

Once you have the etsi library and the ACTG data, you will be able to fully reproduce the results from the paper. To reproduce Table 1 in the paper, run the code in the file etsi_sims_110424.R with the setting set to your desired setting; then use the code in etsi_sims_readin.R to read in the results and create the table. To reproduce Table 2, use the code in etsi_design_sims_110424.R with the desired setting set. The file etsi_sims_truth_and_assumptions.R calculates the truth and checks necessary assumptions for the simulation settings. The files aids_example.R and aids_design.R includes code to reproduce the AIDS illustrations and results.
